# IAT 339 - P02: Company

## Description
In groups of two, you will continue designing a company website. This portion of the project has you coding out the site and completing a fully functional responsive version of the site.

**Any code that is not yours must be cited accordingly.**

## Due
Before your lab time on **Mar 3**.

## Worth
30% of your final grade.

## Instructions
There are a number of weeks in which to complete this project, so please make sure to read the instructions below carefully.

### Starting Jan 27
A reminder that your company website must satisfy the following content requirements:
* company updates/events
* about the company
* how to contact the business
* a multi-product listing
* one product detailed view
* the entire process of purchasing a product
* appropriate means for the user to provide feedback on a product

1. **As a group, choose one company to focus on.** Going forward, you will be working with only one potential company idea.

2. **As a group** consolidate your **style guide into one document.** This should include all the materials required of P01.

3. **As a group** set up your dev environment and **sync it through git.** It should include your consolidated style guide in your files.

4. **As a group** build out a sitemap illustrating all the pages you will be building, include layers illustrating:
  * what elements each page may be using
  * any linking between the pages that will be occurring
  * the hierarchy of pages
  * the titling of pages

#### Due in your Feb 3 lab:
* 1 consolidated style guide
* proof of synced git repository
* 1 sitemap

### Starting Feb 3
1. **As a group, build out structures for each set of components** you require. Remember to:
  * build it using a grid
  * build in the responsive aspects from the start
  * use an understandable naming convention
  * use, and, update your style guide as necessary

2. Having built out your templates, **put together all the pages of your website as a group.** Focus on:
  * linking the pages together
  * just navigation and key headings (do not fill in all the content at this point)
  * ensure that you have all the pages prepared for content
  * do not create pages for every item, link us to one or two example listings from item options

#### Due in your Feb 10 lab:
* 1 set of templates
* 1 complete series of website pages (content not required yet)

### Starting Feb 10
1. **As a group, collect or develop all necessary content** for your website, and make sure to **collect citations** for anything that is not yours. This includes:
  * images (icons, photos)
  * text (headings, body text)
  * within-content considerations (linking, emphasis, hierarchy)

2. **As a group, integrate all your content into your site.** Remember that we are only requiring that two products actually exist in your website, and all other listed products link to those two.

#### Due in your Feb 24 lab:
* 1 set of content
* 1 complete series of website pages (content required)

### Starting Feb 24
1. **Test and debug your website.** This should include testing it on:
  * multiple browsers (IE, Chrome, Safari, Firefox...)
  * multiple devices (mobile phone, tablets, desktop, TVs...)

2. **Update and publish your style guide** along with your website. Make sure it includes the addition of any changes made to the original guide, as well as any layouts or structures created since the beginning of P02.

## Final Delivery
Final deliverables are due to Canvas **before your Mar 3 lab** and double-check all your submitted files and URLs to ensure they can be opened. Delivered should be **one URL for a fully completed website,** which includes footer links to:
* complete style guide
* citation web-page
* your git repository
